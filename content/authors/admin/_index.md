Completing the path from engagement to advocacy.

My research interests focus on the power of digital engagement to spur advocacy on behalf of destinations, with an emphasis on the destination's historical and cultural attributes.  In addition to pursuing my PhD in Texts and Technology, I also teach the Data Driven Decision Making course with the Integrated Business program in the UCF College of Business.
